# SIEM Home Lab Project with Elastic Stack: Alerting and Notifications

1. Introduction
This project demonstrates a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution using Elastic Stack to monitor, detect, and alert on security events. The focus is on setting up alerting and notifications for potential security incidents.

2. Objectives
Set up Elastic Stack as a SIEM tool.
Configure alerting mechanisms to notify about suspicious activities.
Test the alerting pipeline to ensure effective monitoring.

4. Elastic Stack Components Used
Elasticsearch: Core data store and analytics engine.
Logstash: Data processing pipeline for ingestion.
Kibana: Visualization tool for dashboards and alert management.
Elastic Alerting and Notifications: Configured for automatic alerts on security events.

6. Lab Setup and Configuration
System Requirements:

Minimum: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores.
Recommended: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, SSD storage.
Operating System: Kali linux.

Network: Local environment (no direct internet exposure for security).

Installation Steps:

Install Elasticsearch:

bash
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.x.x-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-7.x.x-amd64.deb
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch

Install Logstash:

bash
Copy code
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/logstash/logstash-7.x.x.deb
sudo dpkg -i logstash-7.x.x.deb
sudo systemctl start logstash
sudo systemctl enable logstash

Install Kibana:

bash
Copy code
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-7.x.x-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i kibana-7.x.x-amd64.deb
sudo systemctl start kibana
sudo systemctl enable kibana

5. Configuring Alerting and Notifications
Elastic Stack Alerting Features: Alerting is configured via Kibana and involves setting conditions based on defined rules.

Notification Channels: Configured to send notifications via email or other services when alerts are triggered.

Steps:

Define Alert Rules in Kibana:

Navigate to Management > Alerts and Insights > Alert Rules.
Choose Create Rule and select from predefined rules or create a custom rule for your use case.
Example: Set a rule for failed login attempts to detect brute-force attacks.

Set Alert Conditions:

Define the rule conditions, e.g., when login failures exceed a threshold within a specific timeframe.
Configure severity levels (e.g., low, medium, high) based on risk impact.

Configure Notification Settings:

Add an action to send a notification when an alert is triggered.
Configure email, Slack, or webhook integrations to receive alerts.
Example: Configure an email action to notify administrators of high-severity alerts.

6. Testing the Alerting and Notification Pipeline

Sample Data Generation:

Generate synthetic events to simulate security incidents, such as multiple failed logins or abnormal network traffic.
Use Logstash to ingest this data into Elasticsearch.

Trigger Alerts:

Observe how alerts are generated based on the conditions set.
Verify that notifications are received via configured channels.

Sample Test Case:

Scenario: Detecting brute-force attacks on user accounts.

Steps:
Simulate repeated failed login attempts.
Observe alert generation and ensure notifications are sent.
Verify alert details in Kibana and cross-check with email/Slack notifications.

8. Conclusion
This Elastic Stack home lab successfully demonstrates the core capabilities of SIEM, focusing on alerting and notifications. By configuring automated alerts for common security events, this project provides a foundation for identifying and responding to threats in a controlled environment.
